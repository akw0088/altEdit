# altEdit

Intended to be a basic 3d brush editor (Use GtkRadiant obviously, but figure if I can get basic cube brushes that would be cool), but could serve as a basis for a lot of different tools

Think I might render the brushes with RayMarching / ShaderToy pixel shader only style (single frame as needed to avoid toasting the GPU / consuming a lot of power)

But a basic OpenGL window would probably be more practical. I also like the idea of live editing while the a renderer is running, which I may explore.

(Usually the editor is running a different graphics backend that is lower fidelity, but I think things like blender, unreal, and Unity are at/reaching feature parity)
